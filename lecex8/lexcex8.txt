Converting ER diagrams to relational data model
-------------------------------------------------

1. Map each entity to a relation: the key of the entity becomes the
key of the relation and attributes of the entity become attributes of
the relation

2. For each binary relationship:

- If the relationship has a one side (one to many or one to one), then
  take key for entity on the one side and include it as an attribute
  in the other entity

- If the relationship is many to many, create a new relation which has
  the key of all the entities it connects and the combination of the keys
  if the key of this new relation.

If the relationship has attributes, then include the attributes where
you put the relationship.
